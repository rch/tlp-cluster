Hello there.  If you're reading this, you've probably decided to contribute to tlp-cluster or use the tools for your own work.  Very cool.

INFO:: These docs are a WIP and we are aware of a number of sections that are yet to be completed.

== Overview

tlp-cluster is broken into several subprojects to make each compontent a bit more managable.  Some of these are docker (which are prefixed with `docker-`), some are text generation (such as the manual you're reading now), and others are simply a bit of code that download an artifact.  Each subproject is versioned and may potentially create an artifact which can be downloaded separately, such as the `dashboards` subproject.


== Docker

Each container is versioned and can be built locally using the following:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :PROJECT-NAME:buildDocker
----

where `PROJECT-NAME` is one of the subproject directories you see in the top level.

=== Setup

We recommend updating your local Docker service to use 8GB of memory. This is necessary when running dashboard previews locally. The preview is configured to run multiple Cassandra containers at once.

== Subprojects

=== dashboards

This subproject provides tools to preview the dashboards and build them using the Grafonnet Docker container (from the docker-grafonnet subproject).

=== docker-cassandra-build

This container builds the DEB package that installs Cassandra on a node.

=== docker-pssh

This subproject provides tools to perform provisioning operations in parallel on nodes in the cluster.


== Publishing

. First check circle ci to ensure the build is clean and green.
. Ensure the following are set: `BINTRAY_USER`, `BINTRAY_KEY`, `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, `DOCKER_EMAIL`.  These will be removed
. Perform the following:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :manual:asciidoctor :manual:publish

# optional, if docker containers have changed
./gradlew :docker-cassandra-build:push
./gradlew :docker-pssh:push
# end of optional stuff

./gradlew buildAll uploadAll
----

. Bump the version in `build.gradle`.
